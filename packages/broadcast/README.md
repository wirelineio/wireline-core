# Wireline Broadcast
> Broadcast messages.

Allows a node to originate a message that will be received at least once, within a
reasonably short time, on all nodes that are reachable from the origin node. Messages are
propagated via the `middleware` specified. Broadcast storms are
avoided by means of a [flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_(computer_networking)) routing scheme.

Broadcast messages follows the schema:

```proto
message Packet {
  bytes seqno = 1;
  bytes origin = 2;
  bytes from = 3
  bytes data = 4;
}
```

- `seqno`: By default is a random 32-bit but could be used to provide an alternative sorted sequence number.
- `origin`: Represents the author's ID of the message. To identify a message (`msgId`) in the network you should check for the: `seqno + origin`.
- `from`: Represents the current sender's ID of the message.
- `data`: field is an opaque blob of data, it can contain any data that the publisher wants
it to defined by higher layers (e.g. a presence information message).

Nodes send any message originating locally to all current peers. Upon receiving a message, a
node delivers it locally to any listeners, and forward the message on to its current
peers, excluding the peer from which it was received.

Nodes maintain a record of the messages they have received and originated
recently, by `msgId(seqno + from)`, and the set of peers to which each message has already
been sent. This is used to avoid sending the same message to the same peer
more than once. These records expire after some time to limit memory consumption by: `maxAge` and `maxSize`.

## Install

```
$ npm install @wirelineio/broadcast
```

## Usage

```javascript
import Broadcast from '@wirelineio/broadcast';

const middleware = {
  lookup: async () => {
    // Return the list of neighbors peers with the format:
    // [{ id: Buffer, ...extraArgs }, { id: Buffer, ...extraArgs }]
  },
  sender: async (packet, node) => {
    // Define how to send your packets.
    // "packet" is the encoded message to send.
    // "node" is the peer object generate from the lookup.

    // e.g. If node is a stream
    node.write(packet);

    // e.g. If node is a websocket
    node.send(packet);
  },
  receiver: (onPacket) => {
    // Defines how to process incomming packets.

    // e.g. Using websockets

    const onMessage = data => onPacket(data);
    socket.on('message', onMessage);

    // Return a dispose function.
    return () => {
      socket.off('message', onMessage);
    }
  }
};

const broadcast = new Broadcast({
  id: crypto.randomBytes(32),
  middleware,
  maxAge: 10 * 1000, // Timeout for each message in the LRU cache.
  maxSize: 200 // Limit of messages in the LRU cache.
})

// We initialize the middleware and listeners inside the broadcast.
broadcast.run()

broadcast.publish(Buffer.from('Hello everyone'))

broadcast.stop()
```
